Project Description – Sentimentum: AI-Powered Customer Sentiment Analysis
In today’s competitive e-commerce environment, customer feedback is more than just words—it’s a direct reflection of brand perception, customer satisfaction, and future business growth. With customers increasingly relying on reviews before making purchase decisions, understanding sentiment trends has become essential for sustaining a competitive edge.

This project, Sentimentum, is an AI-powered sentiment classification system designed specifically for e-commerce platforms to automatically detect whether a customer review is positive, negative, or neutral. It eliminates the inefficiencies of manual review monitoring and enables real-time insights for faster decision-making.

The solution addresses three critical business challenges:

Customer Churn Prevention – Quickly identifying and resolving negative feedback to retain loyal customers.

Brand Reputation Management – Tracking sentiment trends to maintain trust and attract new buyers.

Revenue Protection – Preventing loss of sales by proactively addressing dissatisfaction.

The dataset consists of customer reviews sourced from product feedback, surveys, and social media, labeled with their corresponding sentiments. The company has experienced a 200% increase in customer base over three years and a 25% spike in feedback volume, making automation a necessity.

Key Features:

Natural Language Processing (NLP) for text preprocessing, including tokenization, stopword removal, and lemmatization.

Machine Learning Models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines (SVM) for sentiment classification.

Evaluation Metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to ensure robust performance.

Visualization Dashboards to display sentiment distribution and trends over time.

Tech Stack:

Programming Language: Python

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, NLTK, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Deployment: Flask API / Streamlit app (for demonstration)

Impact:
By integrating Sentimentum into the e-commerce platform, businesses can automate sentiment monitoring, generate actionable insights, and take timely corrective actions. This empowers teams to enhance customer experience, boost brand loyalty, and improve profitability through data-driven decision-making.

This repository includes the dataset, preprocessing scripts, model training notebook, evaluation results, and a demo application, making it a complete, deployable solution for AI-driven sentiment analysis in e-commerce.
